# dirty_data_codeclan_project_louise

## Overview

This is a project developed for module 1 of CodeClan.

### Brief Introduction to the dataset
In 2006, David Ng and Ben Cohen began to rank candy based on their location
in geological strata, for trick or treating purposes. This has developed over
the years into a "not quite social science legit survey". As of 2019, this has 
become a way of measuring "net feelies" when trick or treating, for a wide range
of candies, which critically includes items such as hugs, glow sticks and bread.

### Brief introductions to assumptions
- I intially assumed the dataset was complete, i.e. that the columns were correct
(should be there).
- As I began to dig in to it and opened it in excel, I learned that some of
these could be dropped.
- I then over-corrected and tried to drop too many.
- I then began to research the background of the dataset, and found that only
some of these would need to be dropped.
- I assume that many of the NA's can be dropped/changed without causing many problems.
- I assume that respondents will generally only be from the US and Canada.
- I assume that age will only be given in whole numbers.
- That the "random" columns at the end, were indeed random, however upon further
research and reading, I learned that these are indicators for charactor and that
this has an impact on the ratings. I have then begun to think about how I can 
change my data analysis to reflect this, as the time constraints of the project
means that realistically means I will not be able to include all of them.

### Steps to clean the data
- Changing names of columns
- Changing timestamp of 2015 and 2016
- Changing column type of age
