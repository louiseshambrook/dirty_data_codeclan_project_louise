NOTE TO MYSELF - WHEN I PICK UP ON TUESDAY - MOVE NOTES OVER FROM HERE to R SCRIPT

## TO DO
- Assertive programming
- Unit tests


# Dirty Data - Louise Shambrook
## 26/11/2021

### - Required libraries
```{r}
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(assertr)
#calling libraries
```

```{r}
names(candy_2015)
```

## Points to include in final report:
- A brief introduction to the dataset
- A list of any assumptions you have made
- The steps you took to clean the data (you donâ€™t need to write out in detail every step, but a combination of commented code chunks with surrounding overall explanations would be great).
- The answers to the questions presented in the task brief
- Any other interesting analyses or conclusions you come across.

# Final report (draft)

### Brief Introduction to the dataset
In 2006, David Ng and Ben Cohen began to rank candy based on their location
in geological strata, for trick or treating purposes. This has developed over
the years into a "not quite social science legit survey". As of 2019, this has 
become a way of measuring "net feelies" when trick or treating, for a wide range
of candies, which critically includes items such as hugs, glow sticks and bread.

### Brief introductions to assumptions
- I intially assumed the dataset was complete, i.e. that the columns were correct
(should be there).
- As I began to dig in to it and opened it in excel, I learned that some of
these could be dropped.
- I then over-corrected and tried to drop too many.
- I then began to research the background of the dataset, and found that only
some of these would need to be dropped.
- I assume that many of the NA's can be dropped/changed without causing many problems.
- I assume that respondents will generally only be from the US and Canada.
- I assume that age will only be given in whole numbers.
- That the "random" columns at the end, were indeed random, however upon further
research and reading, I learned that these are indicators for charactor and that
this has an impact on the ratings. I have then begun to think about how I can 
change my data analysis to reflect this, as the time constraints of the project
means that realistically means I will not be able to include all of them.

Table 1B. 

### Steps to clean the data
- Changing names of columns
- Changing timestamp of 2015 and 2016
- Changing column type of age

# 2015 CLEANING  --------------------------------------------------------------


# 2016 CLEANING ---------------------------------------------------------------


# Change all versions of USA to USA, and similar for other countries.

# Remove incorrect strings. 

# Clean state column, i.e. ensure all strings are correct.

# Change all USA and canadian states to same format, e.g. TN, USA


# 2017 Cleaning --------------------------------------------------------------


# reassigning the internal_id column to 2017

# Cleaning the age column
# There are 2 answers which indicate a specific answer, e.g. "40. Deal with it".
# There are 5 which reference a vague answer, e.g. "50's". It is not
# reasonable to assume their answer - if there is time, I will go back and
# replace these with "vague" (or similar). Then there are the outright "invalid"
# answers, e.g. "old enough" which do not reference an age. These are NA.


# Clean country names; ensure all countries are capitalised.

# Change all versions of USA to USA, and similar for other countries.

# Remove incorrect strings. 

# Clean state column, i.e. ensure all strings are correct.

# Change all USA and canadian states to same format, e.g. TN, USA

# EXTENSION
# Step 7. For the "please leave"/"please List" columns, create a coding matrix,
# code the data.
# Step 8. Mints - change all non-numeric data to numeric.
# Step 9. Betty/Ver - Change all ?? to NA.
# Step 10. "Check all that apply" - split columns.
# Step 11. Add NA's to all the "random" columns in the blanks.
